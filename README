    This project consist in blablabla.....







Important things:

    -Branch:

        Every time you want to add/fix/delete a feature you must create a new branch using
                                git checkout -b name_of_the_branch

        The name of the branch must be explicit considering the feature u will modify for example
                                [modify/add/delete]_[name of the feature]


    -Commit:

        You must commit dynamically with this prototype
                                [add/fix/rm/update][[fichier name][function name]

        Try to commit after testing function to avoid commit 50 times for the same function

    -Function:

        Every function must be documented to apply for the Doxygen Documentation

        structure:

        /*!
        *    blablabla
        *    blablabla
        *    blablabla
        */

        keywords_head_file: \file  \author  \brief
        keywords_head_function: \param  \return
